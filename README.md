# COMPLEX ALGORITHMS

This project is a set of 3 Javascript algorithms built to sort a list of unsorted numbers, as well as a series of 6 exercices aimed at practicing diffrent levels of comlexity of algorithms. 

## Specifications

The 3 algorithms implemented are: 

* Bubble sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort
* Insertion sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort
* Merge sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort

## How to use

Clone this repository, and run the following commands in the terminal:

1) For the algorithms sorting a list of numbers:

* `$ node sort.js short_list.txt`

* `$ node sort.js medium_list.txt`

* `$ node sort.js long_list.txt`

2) For the series of exercises:

* `$ node exercise_01.js`
